# English-detoxifier

### Description
In our work on developing an English text detoxifier model, we leveraged the powerful BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) architecture, which has shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks, including text generation and translation. To adapt BART for the task of detoxifying text, we fine-tuned the model on a carefully curated parallel corpus consisting of pairs of toxic and non-toxic sentences. This parallel corpus was created by collecting toxic comments from various online sources and manually rewriting them into non-toxic counterparts, ensuring that the semantic meaning was preserved while removing offensive language, hate speech, or other harmful content. By fine-tuning BART on this parallel data, the model learned to map toxic input sequences to their corresponding non-toxic versions, effectively learning the patterns and transformations required to detoxify text. During inference, our fine-tuned BART model can take in potentially toxic text and generate a detoxified version, making it a valuable tool for content moderation, online safety, and promoting healthier online discourse.

### Use cases
- Social media platforms can leverage the text detoxifier model to automatically filter and remove toxic, offensive, or harmful content from user-generated posts, comments, and messages, fostering a safer and more inclusive online environment.
- Educational institutions and online learning platforms can integrate the detoxifier model into their systems to ensure that course materials, discussion forums, and student submissions are free from inappropriate or offensive language, promoting a respectful and conducive learning environment.
- Content moderation teams in various industries, such as news media, entertainment, and e-commerce, can utilize the text detoxifier model as a first line of defense against toxic or abusive content, streamlining their content review processes and reducing the exposure of human moderators to harmful material.
